LegoRemote for Android
======================

Implementation of the Lego Remote Control IR protocol for Android phones with IR blaster (like Samsung Galaxy). 


Status
------

Currently have a working implementation of the Lego Remote Contol with channel 1 through 4 implemented as intent services.

Have a rough UI implemented for controlling steering and power of my [Volvo Wheel Loader](http://www.lego.com/en-gb/technic/products/42030-remotecontrolled-volvo-l350f-wheel-loader) 

Roadmap
-------

The primary goal for this project is to be a fun side project. Once it stops being fun, the project dies.

That said, I think it would be fun to implement the following:

* Nice configurabel UI for the phone
* Web based remote control UI, hosted on the android device accesible from device on same LAN as the Android device.
* Stream video from phone to web UI for real remote operation outside IR range.
